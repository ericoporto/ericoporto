description: <a href="https://github.com/ericoporto/fgmk">FGMK</a> is a software for creating a HTML5 RPG through an easy to use PyQt UI. The project seeks to reach this goal by providing a spec for writing and interpret text files as games, a tool for writing these files in an easy to use interface, and an engine to allow playing these files as a game.
